            <h3>Project</h3>
            <p>Kenya Airways continues with its efforts to turn around to profitability through an aggressive growth plan while maintaining its costs. A Strategic Review on the long term survival of Kenya's aviation industry and Kenya Airways pointed to the need for the development of a holistic strategy. The strategy, which was later developed as a proposal - The Privately Initiated Investment Proposal (PIIP) will create operational synergies between Kenya’s main hub and the national carrier, thereby facilitating the airport and airline to become economic growth drivers. This is an opportunity for the growth of both Kenya Airways (KQ) and Kenya Airports Authority (KAA). </p>
